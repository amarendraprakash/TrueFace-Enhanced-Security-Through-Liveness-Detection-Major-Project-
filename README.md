# Face Liveness Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for my **Final Year Project** in **AIML Engineering**.

## Project Overview

**Face Liveness Detection** is a security system designed to differentiate between a live person and a spoof attempt (such as a photo, mask) in face recognition systems. This project aims to enhance authentication systems by preventing unauthorized access through fake facial representations.

## Features

- Real-time face liveness detection
- Robust against common spoofing attacks
- Uses machine learning and image processing techniques

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (adjust based on your framework)
- Other AIML libraries

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required dependencies  
3. Run the main script to start face liveness detection
